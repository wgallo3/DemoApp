# DemoApp
Web App version of MaidSafe's Demo App

Web-app for modifying of files, folders, and URLs on SAFE

Takes the functionality from MaidSafe's Demo App software and puts it into a simple, download-free website.

ToDo:
 - learn how to upload files with safe-js and add that functionality into a final, additional page
 - learn how to display files with some sort of graphical file explorer and integrate that

Wanted the community to have this for a long time. Hated downloading a whole software package (Demo App) every time a new testnet came out and I wanted to upload files, folders and create websites.

Now we have this!
Enjoy!
